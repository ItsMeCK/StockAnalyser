# AI Stock Analyzer Chat

## üöÄ Overview

The AI Stock Analyzer is an interactive web application that provides users with comprehensive stock analysis through a chat interface. Users can input a stock symbol or company name, ask specific questions, and optionally provide their current position details (shares and average price). The backend, built with FastAPI and LangGraph, processes the query, fetches relevant data (market data, fundamentals, news), performs analysis using Language Models (LLMs), and returns a structured response including technical summaries, fundamental insights, news analysis, direct answers to user questions, overall recommendations, and position-specific advice.

The frontend is a clean, responsive HTML page styled with Tailwind CSS, allowing users to easily interact with the analyzer.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Running the Application

1.  **Clone the Repository** (Assuming you have one)
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended)
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate to the `backend` directory (or wherever your `requirements.txt` is located).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory (or the root, depending on your `load_dotenv()` path in `stock_analyzer.py`). Add the following variables:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
    BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY="your_brave_search_api_key"
    ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY="your_alpha_vantage_api_key" # Can be "demo" for limited use or your own key

    # Optional: For LangSmith Tracing
    # LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
    # LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="[https://api.smith.langchain.com](https://api.smith.langchain.com)"
    # LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your_langsmith_api_key"
    # LANGSMITH_PROJECT="Stock Analyzer Chat App Async" # Or your preferred project name
    ```

5.  **Run the Backend Server**:
    From the `backend` directory (where `main.py` is located):
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```
    Or, if `main.py` is in a subdirectory like `backend/app`, adjust the command accordingly.

6.  **Access the Frontend**:
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/`. The `index.html` file should be served.

## üåê API Endpoint
